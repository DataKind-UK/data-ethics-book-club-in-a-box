## Questions

### Facilitator Prompt Questions

**Note:** Questions are based on [CDEI meeting] ](https://twitter.com/peterkwells/status/1178597424669089792/photo/1)

**Warm up**

- Which of the papers from the recommended reading list did you read? What were your main takeaways?
- What are the main benefits of data science &amp; AI into the financial sector? Prompts (if conversation is slow:
  - More efficient financial markets
  - Increased access to financial products e.g fin tech innovation, or existing finance services
  - Faster access to financial products
  - Personalised services e.g. AI powered chatbots
  - Detecting vulnerable groups earlier to provide support
  - Better detection of economic crime- fraud/money laundering
  - Increased detection of cyber threats
  - Increase finance services efficiency
  - Better risk assessment therefore low costs for customers
  - Efficient compliance (regulatory technology)
- Who are the beneficiaries? Which group benefits the most

**Negative consequences?**

- What do you think some of the major risks within financial services sector arising from the application of data driven technology and AI? Prompts (if conversation is slow:
  - Cyber attacks
  - Extreme market movement (algorithms used to automate trade decisions) &amp; difficulties monitoring algorithmic trade (black box)
  - Lack of transparency
  - Lack of explainability
  - Loss of public trust in financial systems
  - Use of non traditional finance data e.g social media encroaches on privacy
  - Digital exclusion- what about people who don&#39;t use digital- they don&#39;t create lots of data!
  - Preferential access to people who are willing to give lots of data e.g. provide car/fitness sensors to insurers
  - Bias due to use of historical data to predict forwards
  - Consumer disempowerment- asymmetric power as financial services know more about a customer than the customer itself
  - Regulators unable to keep up with AI due to lack of resources
  - Algorithmic collusion (outside of the financial institution)
  - Increased surveillance of finance workers
  - Deskilling of financial workers/ workers have excessive trust in algorithmic recommendations
  - Data monopolies
  - Fear of potential risks reduces AI takeup which could be a benefit
  - Excessive data retention
  - Increased inequality
  - Non-alignment with societal goals

- How do these risks arise?
- Which groups are most affected and how?
-

**General discussion question**

- Consider yourself/family/friends as a consumer (e.g. for credit, car insurance, health insurance). What data would you share? What would be your concerns about its use? What would you want to know about a company&#39;s decision (explainability etc)? And - how should this be regulated/controlled? How have the reading materials and discussion so far changed how you thought about any of this?

**Governance**

- What governance is or should be in place to mitigate for negative consequences?
  - Legislation and regulation
  - Technical solutions (can lead to discussions around fairness- see Michelle Lee&#39;s article)
  - Soft governance (standards and codes)
  - Anything else?
