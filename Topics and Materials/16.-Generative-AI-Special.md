**FAQs**

**​Why are we doing this?**

​DataKind UK encourages responsible, appropriate, and ethical use of data science, and works to inspire everyone else, too. We hope these meets will help you to think about this from day to day, wherever you encounter data. And, you'll enjoy some friendly discussion over a coffee or beer!

**​Do I need to be a data scientist to participate?**

​Not at all. We'll have a mix of technical and non-technical reading material. The aim is to think about data science in a context of ethical impacts and consequences - and that affects everybody!

**​I have a brilliant idea for reading material/a theme! Who do I tell?**

​We love suggestions! Tell us at contact@datakind.org.uk
