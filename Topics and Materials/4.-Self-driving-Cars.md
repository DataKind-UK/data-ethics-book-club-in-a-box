Self-Driving Cars
================

## Materials

### Materials for Book Club

This session we will be discussing **Self-Driving Cars**.

  - [**Car Wars**](https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars)
    **(Cory Doctorow 2016)**
  - Here’s an alternative shorter take from
    [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/the-problem-with-self-driving-cars-who-controls-the-code)
    by the same author

### Further Reading

For those who want more….

*A primer*

  - And for those who would like it, a primer on self-driving cars:

*Impact on inequality *

  - [Academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11097.pdf): Predictive
    Inequity in Object Detection *- systems unable to identify across
    skin colors. *
  - In this work, we investigate whether state-of-the-art object
    detection systems have equitable predictive performance on
    pedestrians with different skin tones. This work is motivated by
    many recent examples of ML and vision systems displaying higher
    error rates for certain demographic groups than others. We annotate
    an existing large scale dataset which contains pedestrians, BDD100K,
    with Fitzpatrick skin tones in ranges \[1-3\] or \[4-6\]. We then
    provide an in depth comparative analysis of performance between
    these two skin tone groupings, finding that neither time of day nor
    occlusion explain this behavior, suggesting\_ **this disparity is
    not merely the result of pedestrians in the 4-6 range appearing in
    more difficult scenes for detection** *. We investigate to what
    extent time of day, occlusion, and reweighting the supervised loss
    during training affect this predictive bias.*

## Questions

### Facilitator Prompt Questions

  - Discuss whether Fictional stories have a place to discuss ethical
    consequences

  - Discuss whether you can boil down self-driving cars to the trolley
    problem? Is this possible, if so why not?

  - Reflect on how you felt about the trolley problem, before and after
    the reading. Discuss if your view has remained the same or changed
    accordingly.

  - Can a manufacturer stop you from changing its programming so that
    your car can never kill you?

  - Discuss whether an owner should hold responsibility for the
    self-driving car if there is an accident? Who else should take
    responsibility? Why?

  - Would you modify the software in your self-driving car to protect
    yourself, even if it was against the law?

  - Can self-driving and ‘dumb’ cars co-exist on the roads?

  - When buying a product embedded with technology, who owns the
    product? The code? Why?

  - Discuss the following statement: *“If self-driving cars can only be
    safe if we are sure no one can reconfigure them without manufacturer
    approval, then they will never be safe.”*

## Notes or other comments

This was our first try of a book club event with one main reading and
then various other sources “for interest”. Also our first one using
fiction\! The *Car Wars* piece was quite good as an unusual jumping-off
point for the discussion.
