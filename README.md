Data Ethics Book Club in a Box
================

DataKind UK Data Ethics Book Club processes and materials

This is [DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/)’s intro to setting up a
data ethics book club. We started in 2019, with seven book club events.
They were run every 6-8 weeks or so in London, Edinburgh and remotely.

There has been interest from others who would like to replicate (and, we
hope, improve\!), and we

It’s not just a books - we used books as well as journal articles,
blogs, news stories, videos of talks and even poems.

The aims of the book club before starting were to:

1.  To foster discussions of ethics issues among our data science
    community, and later on, the wider data science community, that they
    can take back to their day jobs/careers;
2.  To educate and inform our community on ethical issues, to better
    enable them to support social change organisations; and
3.  To strengthen our community of data scientists, social change
    organisations, and data for good enthusiasts.
