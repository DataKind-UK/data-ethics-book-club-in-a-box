Sample FAQs
================

### Why are you doing this?

We think that discussing the ethics and impacts of data science is
important, but also, kind of fun? There’s a lot of good writing out
there and one of the most important principles (even in our own ethical
principles for data scientists) is to discuss and debate the ethical
questions. We hope this will help people gain the tools they need to
think about this in their jobs or in DataKind projects, or in
encountering algorithmic tools in their everyday life. But if all you
get out of it is some friendly discussion over a coffee or beer, that’s
also good.

### Do I need to be a data scientist to participate?

Nope. We’ll have a mix of technical and non-technical reading material.
The aim is to think about data science in a context of ethical impacts
and consequences - and that affects everybody\!

### Do I need to be an ethicist to participate?

Nope. See above. but if you are, we’d love to have you\!

### Do I need to read all of that stuff?

No - the aim is to have different pieces that are of different lengths,
not just books but articles, blogs, even videos. Choose what you want\!

### Do I need to buy a book?

Definitely not. We’re aiming to find free resources whenever possible,
but at most one paid-for thing per session. And we encourage sharing
copies around, going to local libraries, etc. We don’t encourage
pirating, we like authors writing things and want them to get paid for
it\!

### I don’t live in London/can’t make it that day. is there an online option?

We will be hosting an online group alongside the in-person event - if
you’d like to join remotely, please select the ‘remote bookclub’ option
from the ticket options. We’ll also be live tweeting using the hashtag
\#DKbookclub and taking comments/questions. **AND/OR**: We also have an
in-person event in Edinburgh\! see \[*link*\].

### I have a brilliant idea for reading material/a theme\! Who do I tell?
