Book Club Hosting Guide
================

This can help hosts of the book club events - especially useful if you
rotate hosts, have multiple locations or online meetings.

Hosts should also adhere to the Facilitator Guide.

### Opening the Event

  - Intro to DataKind UK and why we are interested in ethics
  - Welcome from the sponsor (e.g. if being hosted at a company’s
    meeting space)
  - Reminder of the topic and materials
  - Reminder of others: We are running the book club simultaneously with
    friends in Scotland and online
  - Tell community this is a safe space:
      - to explore ideas and opinions.
      - Everyone should listen actively with a **generous and open
        mind**
      - do not interrupt or criticise others,
      - consciously aim to help everyone to speak for roughly equal time
      - If anyone feels uncomfortable at any time do speak with
        \[**named responsible individual/s **\]
      - Chatham House
        [rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule)
  - Ask people to get into groups of 6-8
  - Point out the facilitators
  - Ask people to put thoughts on Twitter \[**your hashtag here**\] but
    paraphrase what people say if needed, as it is Chatham House
  - There'll be a break in the middle (go round and remind the groups of
    this at 7:30pm) and give option for people to move groups at this
    time - or any time if they want to\!

### End

  - Ask participants if anyone would like to write a blog about the book
    club around the questions discussed
  - Let everyone know about the next book club
  - No one location, always looking for hosts. if your organisation
    would like to host a bookclub - et us know
      - If you would like to facilitate
      - If you have ideas about future topics
  - We will send out a feedback survey tomorrow.
  - Thanks again to the sponsor
