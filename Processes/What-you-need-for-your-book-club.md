What you need for the book club - processes and planning
================

# Preparation

### Materials

  - **Choose whether you want everyone to read the same single piece or
    have a variety of sources.** DataKind UK’s initial plan was three
    materials (One book, 1 article, 1 paper) connected by an overarching
    theme which encompasses all three texts (and changes each month). In
    practice, we found more than three sources most times, and sometimes
    chose to focus on a single “main” piece.
  - **Consider access** Not everyone wants to buy a book. we made sure
    some/all materials were free each time, and also made people aware
    of loans between community members, library use, etc. for books.
    Some attendees shared a book copy and shared reading duties\!

### What makes for good materials?

  - Range of lengths
  - Range of technical degrees of difficulty (a news article can be just
    as revelatory as an academic data science article, and vice versa.
    This also applies to academic philosophy or sociology articles).
  - Range of media. We used books, online articles, videos, etc. We also
    used fiction and poetry as well as reporting.
  - Range of perspectives. DataKind UK ethics committee made an effort
    to look beyond what was coming out of US institutions. We didn’t
    always succeed, and would like to cover more of a global perspective
    in future (looking for writing out of the global South more). Also
    this can be creative - a review article that quotes a lot of others
    will work\!

### Schedule

  - DataKind UK went with approximately every 6 weeks with some tweaking
    for availability and venues, etc. Choose topic for next book club
    Decide timeline for planning next topic, venue, facilitators,
    materials and publishing event page Add to trello Calendar (power up
    for Trello)

### Location

  - **What sort of event is it?**
      - One location in person only?
      - Remote only?
      - Multiple locations?
      - Asynchronous? (e.g. a month-long slack discussion or twitter
        hashtag)
  - **If in-person:**
      - Who are the hosting venue? If it’s a sponsor do due diligence
        for their reputation, accessibility of the room, inclusivity
        (are there gender-neutral bathrooms?) etc.
      - Will the host expect to speak to attendees about their awesome
        company and how they’re hiring? Set aside time.
      - Check on capacity.
      - Check on entry requirements (Does the building have a real name
        policy at security? Do people need ID? Do they need to be
        escorted through security individually so you have to factor in
        that time?)
  - **If remote:**
      - Decide if via teleconference (and with/without video) or some
        public/invite-only text service like Slack or twitter.
      - Especially relevant for remote events. Are details sent out?
        have you updated software? are there any limits on time or
        number of joiners? Do you need video? Do you want to have
        private subrooms available?
  - **If Asynchronous:**
      - Can be good to start the discussion with a few internal folk
        first.
      - Allocate individuals to days for checking the discussion,
        moderating, and kick-starting it again if needed.
      - DataKind UK hasn’t done this one yet. We consider it an option
        for the future though\!
  - **Combining Locations:**
      - This is theoretically possible but having most people in the
        room and a few on a call and them trying to talk to each other
        is
        [**hard**](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/29/why-do-remote-meetings-suck-so-much/).
        It can be unavoidable in work meetings but in a social book club
        where you’re wanting small-group discussions anyway? It’s
        eminently avoidable.
      - DataKind UK coped with this by:
    <!-- end list -->
    1)  having small group discussions anyway so that even those in the
        room were split out
    2)  making the remote small group discussion completely separate
        from the one going on in the room, with its own facilitator and
        sign-up. This meant we could have tweeting at the same time and
        a blog write-up including any discussions that had gone on, but
        didn’t have to bother as much with technology and
        communications.
    <!-- end list -->
      - This may be needed if you have an author giving a talk for
        example, but treat that as a one-off session.

### Prep for the event

  - **Invite people\!**
      - If within your community only, Slack/newsletter/Meetup/in-person
        spruiking.
      - If public, Twitter, open Eventbrite or Meetup events, etc.
      - In sufficient time that they can read materials.
      - Plan for no-shows. For free public events via platforms like
        Eventbrite and Meetup we got around 50-70% attendance (varies
        with weather, public transport outages, etc). For an onsite work
        event with colleagues and free food, attendance would be higher.
  - **Create and disseminate any pre-work**
      - Do you want people to think about any specific questions in
        advance or even to discuss them ahead of time? Some book clubs
        have pre-meeting questions for consideration or set up an active
        discussion (on Slack for example) before the event. DataKind UK
        considered but never actually did this (yet\!), because of the
        load on volunteer committee members and because it seemed like
        many attendees of the book clubs read things at the last
        minute\!
  - **Decide on host/s and ensure enough potential facilitator/s.**
      - We found that small groups (5-9) were the best size for
        discussion and allocated facilitators accordingly (allowing for
        no-shows as above).
      - Same host every time? rotating host? choose\!
  - **Decide on Designated Tweeter/s (DTs)**
      - We found that people who are engaged in discussions don’t tweet.
        That’s great as it means they’re engaged with the actual
        community around them. However, if you do want to show what’s
        happening and open it up for other perspectives, having 1-2 folk
        who roam between small groups and tweet what they hear, while
        taking a less active role in the discussion themselves, is
        highly recommended.
      - At DataKind UK the staff mainly took on the role of Designated
        Tweeter - not only did they have access to the org twitter
        account, but it meant they could jump between all the groups and
        get a sense of multiple discussions\!
  - **Plan snacks**
      - If at a location. Super important\! Snacks help reading clubs
        [succeed](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/620629).
        Do try and ensure budget for snacks/drinks, if possible, or ask
        people to bring something if they can, as an alternative
        (obviously without any pressure, compulsory food-bringing sounds
        like a bad idea\!).

# On the Day

  - **Getting Ready**
      - Print things. Do you need a list of names to sign people in?
        Large signs pointing along corridors? Hard copies of facilitator
        notes? Get those things\!
      - Get snacks, drinks, cups, nametags and pens.
  - Use the [Hosting Guide](Sample-Hosting-Guide.md).
  - **During Discussion**
      - Keep someone monitoring the door for latecomers (and/or the
        social media for people complaining the teleconferencing link is
        broken…).
      - Make sure Designated Tweeters are tweeting.
      - Use the [Facilitator Guide](Sample-Facilitator-Guide.md).
      - Break for snacks\!
  - **Ending the Book club**
      - Do you want to have groups report back to everybody? If so, each
        small group can nominate a speaker to report e.g. 3 key answers
        to discussion questions or top interesting debates in their
        group.
      - Announce topic for next book club.
      - Give people a chance to come to the staff and talk about any
        discomfort they felt, how to be more inclusive etc.
      - It can be useful to have a pub or cafe in mind to gather
        afterwards for people who want to keep chatting - especially if
        you’re on location in an office and have to be out at a set
        time.

# After the Book Club

  - **Do you want to build a survey?**
      - Maybe you want to survey attendees for feedback to improve the
        book club in the future, or simply to get new ideas for topics
        or materials. This will need to be designed via one of the many
        online tools. IF you have consent to contact people, we suggest
        surveying the next day while people still remember the evening
        clearly\!
      - And of course have a look at the survey results and decide
        whether to make changes.
  - **Summarise and Publicise**
      - You should have found people interested in blogging at the event
        or from your team. Plan for deadlines for drafts/comments and
        edits/publication.
      - Publish\!
      - Improve this repo ;)

# Longer-Term Planning

  - DataKind UK Ethics Committee used Trello to keep a list of potential
    book club topics and materials. This helped us plan in advance.
  - Because we were a volunteer committee, we had book club topics and
    materials only one event ahead each time. It would be possible to
    plan an entire syllabus for a year (with flexibility for new
    articles\!) if you wanted to.
  - It would be possible to do a lot more pre-event work around
    e.g. discussion groups on Slack for conversations as people read,
    warm-up questions posted to attendees the week before, summaries of
    longer works, etc.
